Version 1 - 1/27


Right now what we have is the foundation for what will become the final project. An analogy I can use is if we have the pie crust made and laid out into the pie dish, and now we need all the intricacies of what makes a great triple-berry pie. We have the crowd noise and the song, which has been reverbed to make it sound more ethereal and dream-like to simulate being drunk or altered at a party. Additionally, the glass breaking sound is there as a plot point that is the catalyst for the main storyline. Later to be added are the lines and dialogue that will come in, and I will be using voice actors including myself and some friends to help me out with it. What I’m hoping I’m getting across is an immersive experience for the listener in this foundation, so that they at least believe that they are in the intended setting. I believe everything there now accomplishes that to some degree.


What I’m hoping to do for next time is fully master and articulate the reverb to convey an altered state of mind, and to get a full 3 minutes of audio in, record and include some of the ending dialogue, and add some more sounds as well. I hope that the run time doesn’t run short, and that the plot points are enough to fulfill the time requirement.
